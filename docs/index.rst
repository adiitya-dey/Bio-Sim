Welcome to BiosimA012022's Rossumoya Project documentation!
============================================================
Rossumoya is a small island in the middle of the vast ocean that belongs to the island nation
of Pylandia. The ecosystem on Rossumoya is relatively undisturbed, but Pylandias Environmental
Protection Agency wants to study the stability of the ecosystem.
The long term goal is to preserve Rossumoya as a nature park for future generations.
The ecosystem on Rossumoya is characterized by several different landscape types, lowland, highland
and desert. The fauna includes only two species, one species of herbivores (plant eaters),
and one of carnivores (predators).

The goal of this project a simulation of Russumoya, which would simulate the factors that could
affect the island and its inhabitants to study how the island progresses and the animals survive

An image of this simulation is as shown below

In this project we focus on 3 major Classes:
 * An Island
 * Multiple Lands
 * Animals (carnivore and herbivore)
